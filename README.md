# chinook_DB__GUI_Display
Graphical interface for displaying "chinook" DB using python (tkinter&amp;sqlite3).
# The program displays all the tables in the chinook.db database.
# After selecting a table and datatype, the window will display the selected table.
# By clicking on a column header, the table will be sorted by this column in ascending order.
# Another click will sort the table by column in descending order.
# If the table is deleted during the selection - an error message about it will be given.
# If the DB didn't -  an error message about it will be given and comboboxes won't be displayed.
# Errors will be printed to the file: "./Log/Log_'Date'_'Time'.txt".
